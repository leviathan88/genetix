/**
 * One Max Problem?
 * 
 * What is the maximum sum of a bitstring (1s and 0s) of length N.
 * 
 * Of course it is N, but if you wanted to prove it, you'd need a brute-force search of 2^N time complexity.
 * That is, searching through 2^N different solutions.
 * 
 * 1. Initialize Population
 * 2. Evaluate Population
 * 3. Select Parents
 * 4. Create Children
 * 5. Mutate Children (and go to step 2.)
 * 
 * 
 * Card Example:
 *  - Single card -> CHROMOSOME
 *  - Entire hand -> POPULATION
 *  - Changes you make after every turn -> TRANSFORMATIONS
 *  - Every turn represents one -> GENERATION
 * 
 * GA work via TRANSFORMATIONS on POPULATIONS of CHROMOSOMES over some number of GENERATIONS.
